      <p>It’s Known The Best By Quite A Few;<br>
That Whatever Given To A Woman, <br>
She Gives It Back Multiplied Into Two!<br>
<br>
I Give To You Just A Cliched Hint, <br>
To Let You Know My Opinion’s Tint.<br>
<br>
As a Child If You Give Her Education,<br>
Be Rest Assured About Literacy In Your Entire Generation. <br>
<br>
She Readily Makes Any Niché Feel Like Home,<br>
Where Dullness Will No Longer Freely Roam.<br>
<br>
Her Love For You Will Be Pure And Passionate,<br>
Provided You Give Her, Her Respect Definite.<br>
<br>
She Fills The Void Of a Father, Sister or Brother,<br>
But Her Place Can Be Taken By None Other.<br>
<br>
Even Though Many Treat Her Brutally Out Of Misogny,<br>
She Holds The Tolerance To Control Her Agony.<br>
<br>
She Still Treats You As Nature’s Equal Part,<br>
But Cross The Limit And She’ll Tear You Apart.<br>
<br>
Despite the Gender Biased Role On Her You Implicate,<br>
Trust Me You’re In Real Trouble The Moment She Plans To Retaliate.<br>
<br>
She’s Loving Yet a Fierce Soul,<br>
Red And Flaring Like The Burning Charcoal; <br>
<br>
Definitely One Day The Whole World She’ll Lead, <br>
Because She Can Do More Than Twice What Men Do, While She Bleeds.
